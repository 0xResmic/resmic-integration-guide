### **What Youâ€™ll Need**

- Node.js installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of React.js.
- A crypto wallet for testing (Metamask/ArgentX, Braavos).

### **Step 1: Set Up a React App Using Vite**

To get started, weâ€™ll create a fresh React project using Vite. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new Vite project
npm create vite@latest resmic-app
# Weâ€™ll be using React + JavaScript.

# Navigate to the project folder
cd resmic-app

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Once installed, start the development server to ensure everything is working:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Install the Resmic SDK**

Install the Resmic `npm package` to integrate Resmic into your app:

```bash
npm install resmic
```

---

### **Step 3: Integrate Resmic in Your App**

Hereâ€™s a simple way to integrate Resmic into your app:

### **App.jsx**

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import { CryptoPayment, Tokens, Chains } from 'resmic'

function App() {
  const [paymentStatus, setPaymentStatus] = useState(false) // Returns bool after the payment

  return (
    <>

      <h2>Accept Crypto Payments with Resmic</h2>
      <div className="card">
          <CryptoPayment
            Address={{ EVM: "0x056397760b973BfB921Bc10Be9DA5034B1e921d7", STARKNET: "0x05Ea419aa3Ad67A9f9721dc38257f8Cc1E032b0Ac83ED6b532Aad3e1778c1B9F" }} // Wallet Address to receive Funds.
            Chains={[Chains.Ethereum, Chains['XDC-Network'], Chains.Starknet, Chains.Sepolia]} // Specify blockchains to receive payments.
            Tokens={[Tokens.STARK, Tokens.SETH, Tokens.DAI, Tokens.ETH, Tokens.USDC, Tokens.XDC]} // Specify tokens you want to accept.
            Amount={50} // Amount in USD
            setPaymentStatus={setPaymentStatus}
          />

      </div>
    </>

  )}

export default App;
```

HowÂ [App.js](https://github.com/0xResmic/resmic-integration-guide/blob/main/src/App.jsx)Â should look like after this step.

### **Step 4: Test the Payment Flow**

1. Start your development server using:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
2. Open the app in your browser, click the "Make Payment" button, and test the flow. Youâ€™ll be redirected to the payment pop-up.
3. Use a crypto wallet like MetaMask to complete a payment and see the instant settlement in action.

---

### **Step 5: Customise the Integration**

Resmic allows you to customise payments further:

- Choose Blockchains you want to accept token in.
- Accept multiple cryptocurrencies.
- Customise the payment button.
